# EX 5A Minimum Cost Path
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Python program using A Naive recursive implementation of Minimum Cost Path Problem.

## Algorithm
1. Base Conditions:
   If the current cell (m, n) is out of bounds (i.e., m < 0 or n < 0), return infinity (sys.maxsize) as this is an invalid path.
   If we are at the starting cell (0, 0), return its cost directly as the only cost.

2. Recursive Relation:
   For each cell (m, n), compute the cost to reach it from three possible directions:

   Top (m-1, n)

   Left (m, n-1)

   Diagonal Top-Left (m-1, n-1)

3. Compute Minimum Path Cost:
   Recursively find the minimum of the three possible previous paths and add the current cellâ€™s cost.

4. Return Total Cost:
   Return the accumulated cost which includes the cost at (m, n) plus the minimum cost from any of the valid three directions.

5. Driver Execution:
   Input the desired destination coordinates (R-1, C-1) and call minCost(cost, R-1, C-1) to get the minimum cost path from (0, 0) to (R-1, C-1).

    if (n < 0 or m < 0):
        return sys.maxsize
    elif (m == 0 and n == 0):
        return cost[m][n]
    else:
        return cost[m][n] + min( minCost(cost, m-1, n-1),
                                minCost(cost, m-1, n),
                                minCost(cost, m, n-1) )
def min(x, y, z):
    if (x < y):
        return x if (x < z) else z
    else:
        return y if (y < z) else z
cost= [ [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 8, 2],
        [1, 5, 3] ]
print(minCost(cost, R-1, C-1))

## Result:
Thus the above program was executed successfully for finding the minimum cost.
